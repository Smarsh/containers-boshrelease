Containers BOSH Release
=======================

This BOSH release lets you run any number of containers, on a
per-VM basis.  This allows you to bring Dockerized workloads (with
OCI-compliant images) to BOSH, with the lifecycle you've come to
know and love.

For more information, read [Putting Docker Compose on top of
BOSH (or: I May Never Write Another BOSH Release Again)][1].
