  This job allows you to colocate local users who are immediately
  dumped into a container running an image of their choice, with
  their persistent home directories mounted.

  This enables a jumpbox-like experience, without needing constant
  redeploys to pick up new tools, updates, and environmental
  customizations.

templates:
  bin/pre-start: bin/pre-start
  bin/shell:     bin/shell

properties:
  hostname:
    description: What hostname to set in each jumpbox container
    default:     unnamed.jump.box.local

  users:
    description: |
      A list of local users, their SSH keys, and prefered images.
      To specify more than one authorized key in the `key` property,
      just make it a newline string, or a list.

      The full list of supported keys (per user entry) is:

        username       (required) The username for this user.

        key            (required) The SSH authorized key for this user.

        image                     The Docker image to spin up for this
                                  user when they log in successfully.

        home                      The path (in the container) to mount
                                  this users home directory into.

        shell                     The login shell to use (in-container).

    example: |
      users:
        - username: jhunt
          image:    'huntprod/jumpbox:jhunt'
          key:       ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1...JvthCmK jhunt@laptop

  default.image:
    default:     'huntprod/cf-jumpbox:latest'
    description: |
      The default image to use for users who do not have one listed
      explicitly.  The Dockerfile for the _default_ default image
      can be found in the `docker-boshrelease` GitHub repository,
      under `jumpbox/`.

  default.home:
    default:     /home/(username)
    description: |
      The default path (in the container) where the users persistent
      home directory will be mounted.  The string `(username)` will
      be replaced by the actual username for the account.

  default.shell:
    default:     /bin/bash
    description: |
      The default login shell to use (in the container) for accounts
      that do not explicitly specify one.  This should probably exist
      inside of whatever image you set for `default.image`.

  homes:
    default: /var/vcap/store/jumpbox/home
    description: |
      Where to store user home directories on the jumpbox/docker VM.
      Each user gets a directory underneath this path, which gets
      mounted into their container image every time they log in.

      By default, these home directories are stored on persistent disk;
      but if you need to move it, you can.  Note that BOSH will always
      have a `store` directory, even if you don't provision a persistent
      disk to mount it on.
