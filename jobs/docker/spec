properties:
  bind:
    description: |
      By default, the `docker` daemon is only bound to the local UNIX
      domain socket (`unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock`).
      However, there are circumstances where you may want or need to
      interact with Docker from outside the BOSH VM, over a TCP link.

      In those cases, you can set this to a TCP port number, and Docker
      will also bind on that port, all interfaces, in addition to the
      standard UNIX domain socket.

      Be very careful about enabling this; Docker has zero authentication
      and will gladly perform any action requested of it by anyone who
      can connect to the (public) TCP port.  Make sure you are behind a
      firewall, at the very least.

  recipe:
