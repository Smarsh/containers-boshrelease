properties:
  bind:
    description: |
      By default, the `docker` daemon is only bound to the local UNIX
      domain socket (`unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock`).
      However, there are circumstances where you may want or need to
      interact with Docker from outside the BOSH VM, over a TCP link.

      In those cases, you can set this to a TCP port number, and Docker
      will also bind on that port, all interfaces, in addition to the
      standard UNIX domain socket.

      Be very careful about enabling this; Docker has zero authentication
      and will gladly perform any action requested of it by anyone who
      can connect to the (public) TCP port.  Make sure you are behind a
      firewall, at the very least.

  recipe:
    description: |
      The full docker-compose recipe to run, via `docker-compose up -d'.

  files:
    description: |
      A map, keyed by relative file path, of additional files to create
      and use in bind mounts of the docker-compose recipe.

  insecure-registries:
    default: []
    description: |
      A list of registry endpoints that are either not TLS-protected,
      or are protected by TLS certificates that are unverifiable by the
      Docker daemon (during a `docker pull`) -- either because they are
      self-signed certificates, or because the CA that signed them is
      ultimately not trusted by the BOSH VM.

      If your registry resides on a non-standard port, you will need
      to include the port (colon-separated) when you list it.
